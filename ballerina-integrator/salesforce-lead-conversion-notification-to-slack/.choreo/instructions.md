## What It Does

- Subscribes to Salesforce Change Data Capture events for Lead objects
- Detects when a lead is converted (`IsConverted` is set to `true`)
- Fetches full conversion details from Salesforce — including the associated Account, Contact, Opportunity, and Owner
- Routes the notification to a team-specific Slack channel based on the lead owner's role, falling back to a default channel
- Sends a formatted Slack message with conversion details, lifecycle duration, and a direct link to the opportunity
