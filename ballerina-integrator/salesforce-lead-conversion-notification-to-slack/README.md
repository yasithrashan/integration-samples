# Salesforce Lead Conversion Notification to Slack

## Description

This integration listens for Salesforce Lead change events in real time and automatically sends a Slack notification whenever a lead is converted. It fetches full conversion details from Salesforce — including the associated account, contact, and opportunity — and posts a formatted message to the appropriate Slack channel, optionally tagging the lead owner.

### What It Does

- Subscribes to Salesforce Change Data Capture events for Lead objects
- Detects when a lead's `IsConverted` flag is set to `true`
- Queries the full lead details including:
  - ID
  - Name
  - Company
  - Lead Source
  - Owner
  - Converted Account
  - Converted Contact
  - Converted Opportunity
  - Created Date and Converted Date
- Fetches related Salesforce records (Account, Contact, Opportunity, Owner)
- Calculates the lead lifecycle duration in days
- Routes the notification to a team-specific Slack channel based on the owner's role (falls back to a default channel)
- Sends a formatted Slack message with conversion details and a direct link to the opportunity
- Supports optional filtering by lead source or owner ID

## Prerequisites

Before running this integration, you need:

### Salesforce Setup

2. OAuth2 credentials:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - Refresh Token
   - Refresh URL
   - Base URL (your Salesforce instance URL)
3. Change Data Capture must be enabled for the **Lead** object in Salesforce

This integration uses refresh token flow for auth. [Learn how to set up Salesforce OAuth](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.create_a_local_external_client_app.htm&type=5).

### Slack Setup

1. A Slack app with a Bot Token
2. The bot must be invited to all channels it will post to
3. Scopes Required:
   - `chat:write`
   - `channels:read` (optional, for channel resolution)
